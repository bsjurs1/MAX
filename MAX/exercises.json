[{ "name": "Squats", "description": "This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack to just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n\nHold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n\nBegin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and hips as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n\nBegin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n\nCaution: This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly."},
 { "name": "Dead lifts", "description": "Stand in front of a loaded barbell.\n\nWhile keeping the back as straight as possible, bend your knees, bend forward and grasp the bar using a medium (shoulder width) overhand grip. This will be the starting position of the exercise. Tip: If it is difficult to hold on to the bar with this grip, alternate your grip or use wrist straps.\n\nWhile holding the bar, start the lift by pushing with your legs while simultaneously getting your torso to the upright position as you breathe out. In the upright position, stick your chest out and contract the back by bringing the shoulder blades back. Think of how the soldiers in the military look when they are in standing in attention.\n\nGo back to the starting position by bending at the knees while simultaneously leaning the torso forward at the waist while keeping the back straight. When the weights on the bar touch the floor you are back at the starting position and ready to perform another repetition.\n\nPerform the amount of repetitions prescribed in the program."},
 { "name": "Bench press", "description": "Lie back on a flat bench. Using a medium width grip (a grip that creates a 90-degree angle in the middle of the movement between the forearms and the upper arms), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position.\n\nFrom the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.\n\nAfter a brief pause, push the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out. Focus on pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Lock your arms and squeeze your chest in the contracted position at the top of the motion, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it.\n\nRepeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.\n\nWhen you are done, place the bar back in the rack."},
 { "name": "Hamtring curls", "description": "Adjust the machine lever to fit your height and lie face down on the leg curl machine with the pad of the lever on the back of your legs (just a few inches under the calves). Tip: Preferably use a leg curl machine that is angled as opposed to flat since an angled position is more favorable for hamstrings recruitment.\n\nKeeping the torso flat on the bench, ensure your legs are fully stretched and grab the side handles of the machine. Position your toes straight (or you can also use any of the other two stances described on the foot positioning section). This will be your starting position.\n\nAs you exhale, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting the upper legs from the pad. Once you hit the fully contracted position, hold it for a second.\n\nAs you inhale, bring the legs back to the initial position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n\nCaution: Do not ever use so much weight on the exercise that you start using swinging and jerking as you can risk both lower back injury and also a hamstring injury.\n\n\nVariations: Since you have three foot positions you have in reality three exercises. The movement can also be performed with a dumbbell held in between your feet (a partner needs to place it properly). This latter exercise though is only suitable for advanced trainees. Finally, it is also possible to just use one leg at a time for better isolation."},
 { "name": "Leg press", "description": "Using a leg press machine, sit down on the machine and place your legs on the platform directly in front of you at a medium (shoulder width) foot stance. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n\nLower the safety bars holding the weighted platform in place and press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended in front of you. Tip: Make sure that you do not lock your knees. Your torso and the legs should make a perfect 90-degree angle. This will be your starting position.\n\nAs you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.\n\nPushing mainly with the heels of your feet and using the quadriceps go back to the starting position as you exhale.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and ensure to lock the safety pins properly once you are done. You do not want that platform falling on you fully loaded.\n\n\nCaution: Always check to make sure that when you re-rack the weight the platform is securely locked.\n\n\nVariations: All foot stance variations described in the foot stance section."},
 { "name": "EZ-Curls", "description": "Stand up straight while holding an EZ curl bar at the wide outer handle. The palms of your hands should be facing forward and slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. Keep your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position.\n\nNow, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps. Focus on only moving your forearms.\n\nContinue to raise the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the top contracted position for a moment and squeeze the biceps.\n\nThen inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n\nVariations: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement.\n\n\nYou may also use the closer grip for variety purposes."},
 { "name": "Sit-ups", "description": "Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees.\n\nPlace your hands behind your head and lock them together by clasping your fingers. This is the starting position.\n\nElevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Breathe out when performing this part of the exercise.\n\nOnce you feel the contraction for a second, lower your upper body back down to the starting position while inhaling.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\nVariations:This exercise can be performed with a weighted plate being held by both arms resting on the chest. The way to perform this exercise is to cross your arms by making an X and grabbing the weighted plate. Note: Your hands will no longer be behind your head.\n\nThis variation may be difficult to perform at first so start out using little to no weights until you feel comfortable with the movements."},
 { "name": "Shoulder press", "description": "While holding a dumbbell in each hand, sit on a military press bench or utility bench that has back support. Place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs.\n\nNow raise the dumbbells to shoulder height one at a time using your thighs to help propel them up into position.\n\nMake sure to rotate your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position.\n\n Now, exhale and push the dumbbells upward until they touch at the top.\n\nThen, after a brief pause at the top contracted position, slowly lower the weights back down to the starting position while inhaling.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n\nVariations: You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one."},
 { "name": "Chin-up", "description": "Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing your torso and a grip closer than the shoulder width.\n\nAs you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, keep your torso as straight as possible while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking your chest out. This is your starting position. Tip: Keeping the torso as straight as possible maximizes biceps stimulation while minimizing back involvement.\n\nAs you breathe out, pull your torso up until your head is around the level of the pull-up bar. Concentrate on using the biceps muscles in order to perform the movement. Keep the elbows close to your body. Tip: The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work other than hold the bar.\n\nAfter a second of squeezing the biceps in the contracted position, slowly lower your torso back to the starting position; when your arms are fully extended. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement.\n\nRepeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions."},
 { "name": "Row", "description": "For this exercise you will need access to a low pulley row machine with a V-bar. Note: The V-bar will enable you to have a neutral grip where the palms of your hands face each other. To get into the starting position, first sit down on the machine and place your feet on the front platform or crossbar provided making sure that your knees are slightly bent and not locked.\n\nLean over as you keep the natural alignment of your back and grab the V-bar handles.\n\nWith your arms extended pull back until your torso is at a 90-degree angle from your legs. Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.\n\nKeeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n\nCaution: Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so."},
 { "name": "Back flies", "description": "Run a band around a stationary post like that of a squat rack.\n\nGrab the band by the handles and stand back so that the tension in the band rises.\n\nExtend and lift the arms straight in front of you. Tip: Your arms should be straight and parallel to the floor while perpendicular to your torso. Your feet should be firmly planted on the floor spread at shoulder width. This will be your starting position.\n\nAs you exhale, move your arms to the sides and back. Keep your arms extended and parallel to the floor. Continue the movement until the arms are extended to your sides.\n\nAfter a pause, go back to the original position as you inhale.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n\nVariations: You can perform this exercise on a rear delt machine as well or using a pulley machine."},
 { "name": "Barbell curls", "description": "Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at a shoulder-width grip. The palm of your hands should be facing forward and the elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position.\n\nWhile holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move.\n\nContinue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard.\n\nSlowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."},
 { "name": "Decline crunch", "description": "Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and lie down.\n\nNow place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.\n\nWhile pushing the small of your back down in the bench to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off it.\n\nContinue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the bench only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the bench. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.\n\nAfter the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n\nVariations: There are many variations for the crunch. You can perform the exercise with weights, or on top of an exercise ball or on a flat bench."},
 { "name": "Triceps press", "description": "Sit down on a bench with back support and grasp a dumbbell with both hands and hold it overhead at arm's length. Tip: a better way is to have somebody hand it to you especially if it is very heavy. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position.\n\nKeeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n\n Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.\n\nRepeat for the recommended amount of repetitions."},
